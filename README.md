# Sustainable Logging
 GUI app to track number of trees in an area.

This was one of my first project.
This project uses Tkinter and Python.
We created a GUI app that helps track down the number of different types of trees in a region.


I worked with my group memebers Muhammad Jamal and Hassan Khawar on this project
